## Example

	role = "test_role"
	runtime = "python2.7"
}
```


```

Error: The "python2.7" runtime has reached the end of support. (aws_lambda_function_deprecated_runtime)

  on template.tf line 4:
   4:   runtime  = "python2.7" // end of support reached!

```

## Why

AWS no longer supports these runtimes.

## How To Fix

Update to a newer runtime. Supported runtimes can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html)
